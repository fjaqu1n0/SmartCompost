# SmartCompost
Web Interface created for a Capstone Project.
- Monitors 5 compost variables namely: Air Humidity and Temperature, Soil Temperature, Moisture, and pH.
- Fetches real-time sensor data from a database.
- Used Chart.js for the line charts
- PHP is used for fetching real-time data. Can't be used on Github Pages. Can use SQL file for testing locally.
- Server-side PHP is used for fetching data for Chart.js and the Table.js file
- Website connects to a Raspberry Pi server for manual controls to a compost machine.
- Website is still a work in progress. Just had to make a repository for easy access.
